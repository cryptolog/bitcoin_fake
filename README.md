# bitcoin_fake

# Intro.
This is a program written in the GO language that simply mimics a blockchain implementation written by the existing blockchain principle. (most basic)

# Plan
- [x] 1 - Initial blockchain frame
- [x] 2 - Add PoW working mechanism
- [ ] 3 - Trading and bookkeeping
- [ ] 4 - Address and identity
- [ ] 5 - More...

# Amusement
The name bitcoin_fake ……emmm…… After all, it’s like a bitcoin of the cottage version.

Writing this project is just to get to know the implementation principle of the blockchain.
I only know a little about it before, and it is totally not enough.

Then I remembered that I directly changed the source code of bitcoin and wrote a kfcoin few years ago：https://github.com/kfcoin/kfcoin
